# School_Disctrict_Analysis
# After sorting through and cleaing the data above. The analysis provided me with insight into certain indicators about this school disctricts performance across each grade, each school, and by their scores respecfutlly. While doing the analysis I was able to find out the mean math score for the whole district which was 64.67. I was also able to find out the lowest reading score across the whole district as well, which was 10.5. From there I dug deeper into each school's performances as well as broke it down grade by grade to see who was performing the best and who potentially needed more work. Then I went and selected the school type to compare public school versus charter schools performances. While I only found the math score for this comparison. This could be done for any of the test scores provided to compare across the different school types.
